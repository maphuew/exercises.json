    "Place your hands lightly on either side of your head keeping your elbows in. Tip: Don\u0027t lock your fingers behind your head.",
    "Push the small of your back down in the floor in order to better isolate your abdominal muscles. This will be your starting position.",

Your shoulders should come up off the floor only about four inches, and your lower back should remain on the floor. Breathe out as you execute this portion of the movement. Squeeze your abdominals hard at the top of the contraction and hold for a second. Tip: Focus on a slow, controlled movement. Refrain from using momentum at any time.",
