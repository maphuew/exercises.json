    "Start by standing straight and holding a barbell behind your glutes at arm\u0027s length while using a pronated grip (palms will be facing back away from the glutes) and having your hands shoulder width apart from each other.",
    "You should be looking straight forward while your feet are shoulder width apart from each other. This is the starting position.",
    "While exhaling, slowly elevate the barbell up by curling your wrist in a semi-circular motion towards the ceiling. Note: Your wrist should be the only body part moving for this exercise.",
    "Hold the contraction for a second and lower the barbell back down to the starting position while inhaling.",
    "Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",
    "When finished, lower the barbell down to the squat rack or the floor by bending the knees. Tip: It is easiest to either pick it up from a squat rack or have a partner hand it to you."
